Data Driven Detroit created the data by selecting locations from NETS and ESRI business data with proper NAICS codes, then adding and deleting though local knowledge and confirmation with Google Streetview. These locations are Grocery stores which primarily sell food and don't include convenience stores. Visual confirmation cues included the existence of the word &quot;grocery&quot; in the name, or the presence of shopping carts.
