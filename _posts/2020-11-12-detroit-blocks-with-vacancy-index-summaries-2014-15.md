The D3 vacancy index was designed to provide a more nuanced assessment of structural vacancy than the &quot;occupied/unoccupied/maybe&quot; categories used in the Motor City Mapping windshield survey. The dataset includes several sources, including Motor City Mapping, utility data, and other resources to create a score evaluating the occupancy status of a parcel. These values are then coded as &quot;Likely Occupied&quot;, &quot;Potentially Vacant&quot;, &quot;Likely Vacant&quot;, and &quot;Very Likely Vacant&quot;, helping to show a spectrum of vacancy across Detroit at three points in time: July 2014, November 2014, and May 2015.<div><br /></div><div>Because the vacancy index incorporates proprietary data sources, D3 is unable to release the raw values of the index to the public at the address level. To allow the public to obtain some of the benefit from this highly-effective tool, however, D3 aggregated this data to the Census block level. This file allows Detroit's policymakers and community members to track vacancy across the city using data that is as up-to-date as possible.</div><div><br /></div><div>Field description metadata are available upon request.</div>
