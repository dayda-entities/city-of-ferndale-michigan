The Ferndale Police Department protects the rights and safety of all persons within its jurisdiction. In order to more effectively carry out our public safety function, we seek to reflect the diversity of the city within our department. As part of this commitment to diversity, the Ferndale Police Department is releasing an open data set of Officer Demographics so that citizens can better understand the makeup of the officers serving their community. It is our hope that increased transparency will help foster increased trust between officers and the citizens we serve.
