Registered sex offenders are not permitted to live within these buffers. When a sex offender moves, they are required by law to register with the local law enforcement, who must verify that the address is not within a safety zone. <br /><br />Though the definition of a school safety zone could change with legislation, the parameters that were used to create this data were: <br /><ul><li>A buffer of 1000’ from the parcel boundary of the school (versus just the centroid of the parcel, or from the building itself)</li><li>Any K-12 school, public or private, should have a buffer. </li><li>Teaching needs to occur in the building (i.e., not admin-only buildings)</li><li>Preschools and day cares are excluded</li></ul><p>This polygon feature class was originally created by buffering the 
Oakland County's Educational feature class. The key attributes include 
the facility Name, Address,Type (Elementary, Middle, High) and Access 
(Public, Private).</p>
