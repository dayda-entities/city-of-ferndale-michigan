This list of full-line grocery stores was ground-truthed between June - December 2013 as part of the Detroit Food Map project surveying nutritional access in Detroit's grocery stores. These 77 full-line grocery stores were checked against a list from the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation (DEGC). The definition of a full-line grocery store is one that sells a line of dry groceries, canned goods, or nonfood items as well as perishable items such as fresh produce, meat, and dairy products.
