<p>This dataset contains the locations of all properties that have been 
sold by the Detroit Land Bank Authority under their Home Auction program. This 
program auctions off residential structures in targeted neighborhoods to 
homebuyers who are willing to commit to making an investment in rehabilitating 
and occupying that building. More information on the side lot program can be 
found here: <a href='http://www.buildingdetroit.org/our-programs/auction-program/' target='_blank'>http://www.buildingdetroit.org/our-programs/auction-program/</a>. This 
dataset includes information on purchasers, as well as the cost of the 
transaction and the date that the purchase closed. <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/DLBA_ProgramSales/Metadata_DLBAAuctionClosings.xls' target='_blank'>Field description metadata are available for download</a> to provide more detail on the specific contents of 
the dataset.</p>
<p>The analyst downloaded these data in their raw format from the City of 
Detroit's Open Data Portal on March 31, 2015. The analyst then geocoded the data 
to spatialize the properties and assign parcel IDs to the records. </p>
