<p>In the fall of 2013, the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force commissioned 
Data Driven Detroit (D3), the Michigan Nonprofit Association, and LOVELAND 
Technologies to complete a survey of every parcel in the City of Detroit. This 
effort, called Motor City Mapping, leveraged relationships with the Rock 
Ventures family of companies and the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation to 
assemble a dedicated team of over 200 resident surveyors, drivers, and quality 
control associates. From December 4, 2013, to February 16, 2014, the team 
collected data on over 370,000 properties, including information on use and 
condition of structures, fire damage, boarding, and the presence of dumping. 
This dataset formed the centerpiece of the Blight Removal Task Force's report, 
&quot;Every Neighborhood has a Future...and It Doesn't Include Blight.&quot;</p>
<p>Following the completion of the survey, D3 and LOVELAND have continued 
to collaborate on a second phase of the Motor City Mapping project, involving 
the build-out of a technology infrastructure intended to keep the data updated 
as conditions change across the city. LOVELAND issued a public release of the 
&quot;Blexting&quot; application used to conduct the initial survey, allowing Detroit's 
residents, workers, and community organizations to survey properties across the 
city. Responses, or &quot;blexts&quot;, are reviewed by a quality-control team to ensure 
that the information is consistent with the standards set forth by D3 and 
LOVELAND, and then are displayed publicly on www.motorcitymapping.org. This file 
consists of the most recent &quot;blext&quot; for each parcel through October 1, 2014, the 
date that responsibility for surveying and quality control transitioned from D3 
to LOVELAND.</p>
<p>In addition to the MCM dataset, D3 has enhanced this file with several 
other datasets, including 2014 tax foreclosures and delinquency, likely public 
ownership, and building footprint information. The tax foreclosure data flags 
properties that were likely headed to Tax Foreclosure as of August, 2014, while 
the tax delinquency data dates to June, 2014. Likely public ownership identifies 
properties identified by one of several sources as being owned by a public 
entity as of 2013/2014, while the building footprint information has been 
aggregated to parcel and dates to 2008.</p>
<p>Metadata accompanying this dataset includes <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/MCM_Enhanced_10012014/Metadata_MCM_Enhanced_10012014.xls' target='_blank'>field description metadata</a> and a <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/MCM_Enhanced_10012014/MCM_10012014_Enhanced_Documentation_11242014.pdf' target='_blank'>narrative document</a> describing the process of creating the final 
file.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing how this data can lead to a deeper 
understanding of Detroit! For more information about the Blight Removal Task
