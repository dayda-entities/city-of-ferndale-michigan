This dataset contains lead blood levels, by County Subdivision, for the state of Michigan in 2017. An elevated blood lead level (EBLL) was defined by blood lead levels above 4.5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). Data Driven Detroit received lead blood level test results for individuals in the state from Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and then aggregated the data to anonymize results. <div><br /></div><div>Click <a href='http://www.datadrivendetroit.org/metadata/LeadBloodLevels_2017_byCountySubdivision_Metadata_20181129.xlsx' target='_blank'>here</a> for metadata (descriptions of the fields).</div>
