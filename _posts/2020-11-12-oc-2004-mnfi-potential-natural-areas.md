The polygons 
contained in this feature class were derived from data developed for the
 2004 Oakland County Natural Areas Report update. Each feature was 
assigned a priority of One, Two, or Three. Digital Landcover, 
orthophotography, and USGS quadrangle maps were the main sources used to
 identify each natural area. The data from the Oakland County Natural 
Areas update project was collected in 2004. Key attributes include 
Priority and TotalScore. &quot;Priority&quot; is a reflection of quality and 
indicates the level of priority to retain or conserve the natural state 
of the identified area.<br /><br />The NaturalArea2004 data should be distributed with the <a href='https://mnfi.anr.msu.edu/reports/2004-26-Oakland-County-2004-Natural-Areas-Report.pdf' target='_blank'>Oakland County Potential Conservation/Natural Areas Report - April 2004</a>.

Headwaters Resource Preservation Project involved six communities 
(Highland, Milford, Rose, Springfield, and White Lake Townships, and the
 Village of Milford) in western Oakland County. A Steering Committee 
composed of local officials, developers, property owners, and land 
conservancy members was the policy group that directed the project. The 
Steering Committee contracted with the Michigan Natural Features 
Inventory (MNFI) to identify potentially significant natural areas. <br /><br /><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Oakland County Potential Conservation/Natural Areas Report - July 2002 </span><br />Prepared by: <br />John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation <br />Michael Penskar, Program Leader - Botany <br />Helen Enander, Information Technologist I <br /><br /><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Oakland County Potential Conservation/Natural Areas Report - April 2004 </span><br />Prepared by: <br />John Paskus, Associate Program Leader - Conservation <br />Helen

 report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in 
Oakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the 
landscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of 
potential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural 
features. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological 
services such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil 
development and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel 
corridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic 
diversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological 
value of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground
 biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural 
Features Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas 
can also be used to update and track the status of these remaining 
sites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local 
municipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize 
conservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an
 open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. <br /><br />In
 this report the term &quot;potential natural area&quot; has been used in place of
 the term &quot;potential conservation area&quot;. The substitution was made in 
order to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites 
that are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better 
understanding of the term &quot;natural area&quot;. The term &quot;potential natural 
area&quot;, however, is not to be confused with the legal term &quot;dedicated 
Natural Area&quot; as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of
 the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which 
gives land special legal protection.<br /><br />When using this information 
it is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a 
starting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, 
each community, group or individual using this information should 
determine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more
 exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. <br /><br /><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Materials and Interpretation Methodology: </span><br />Interpretation
 of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using 
digital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland 
County Potential Conservation/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's
 Planning and Economic Development Services Division. <br /><br />As the 
townships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this 
imagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council 
of Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for 
Geographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b),
 and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These 
additional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the 
interpretation process. <br /><br />Delineation of sites was done through 
aerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) 
wetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested 
tracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done 
conservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up 
being eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of 
omitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated 
by focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much 
development (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as 
possible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads,
 parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural 
areas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal 
boundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the 
boundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all 
sites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. <br /><br />Following
 the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential 
natural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based
 upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to
 first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each 
site could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total 
calculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.
