Parks and Plazas within the Downtown Detroit Business Improvement zone. Contains a field which indicates whether the Park/Plaza is managed or maintained by the Downtown Detroit Parntership or Business Improvement Zone. The riverwalk and DTE Grand River Park were digitized in 2017 from aerial imagery. All other polygons were copied from long-standing shape files, likely sourced from the City of Detroit.
