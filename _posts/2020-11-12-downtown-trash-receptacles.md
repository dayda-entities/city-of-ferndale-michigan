Locations of Clean Downtown program trash cans for pickup. Includes both City-owned and program-owned cans that are part of regular pickup. Clean Downtown also has cans along the riverfront and some in midtown that are not represented in these data. Data was supplied to Data Driven Detroit from the Downtown Detroit Partnership in 2014.
