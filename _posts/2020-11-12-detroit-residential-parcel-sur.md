In 2009, Data Driven Detroit partnered with Living Cities, the Detroit Office of Foreclosure Prevention and Response and Community Legal Resources (Michigan Community Resources) to conduct a survey of 1-4 unit residential structures and vacant lots in the City of Detroit.  Surveyors went out in the field in August and September of 2009, and following this, data were entered into a database and cleaned.  The survey collected information on property type, condition, vacancy, danger to the surrounding community, fire damage, and improvements on vacant lots.For more information on the DRPS, including aggregations and maps of the original data, please visit www.detroitparcelsurvey.org.<div><br /></div><div>Upon request, field description metadata is also available for this dataset.</div>
