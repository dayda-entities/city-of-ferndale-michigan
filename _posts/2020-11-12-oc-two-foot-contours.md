Contours created on 12/13/18. The 1-foot elevation contours were presented as a feature class in an Esri ArcGIS 10.3 File Geodatabase. The contours were derived from Bare-Earth (DEMs) created from QL2 LiDAR data. Source Data Description: MI 2016 LiDAR project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of LIDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of Michigan State Plane South, NAD83(2011), international feet and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), international feet. Deliverables included classified LAS, Raw LAS, Bare-Earth hydro-flattened DEMs, Breaklines and Intensity images. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring or fall, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels.

Data created for use in planning, design, assessment, research, general mapping and hydrologic modeling. These 2' contours were created by Oakland County from the 1' contours provided by the State of Michigan in December, 2018.
