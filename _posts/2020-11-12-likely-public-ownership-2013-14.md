<div>This file identifies likely public ownership based on several categorizations. These include the City of Detroit, the Detroit Land Bank Authority, the Michigan Land Bank Fast Track Authority, the State of Michigan, Wayne County, the United States Government, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, and Detroit Public Schools. The ownership information generally dates from 2013 to early 2014; see the field description metadata for further information.</div><div><br /></div><div>DISCLAIMER: This file seeks to identify parcels that are owned by a governmental or other public entity. However, ownership of properties changes frequently, particularly between public entities, and the data sources that this file is built from date from 2013 through the spring of 2014. Since there has been considerable time for the ownership of some of these properties to change, D3 is producing this file as an indicator of Likely Public Ownership.This file is intended to help highlight the breadth and scale of public ownership in the City of Detroit, and any decisions based off of this file should be confirmed through investigating legal ownership records.</div><div><br /></div><div>Metadata associated with this file includes <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/Likely_Public_Ownership/LikelyPublicOwnership_Metadata.xls' target='_blank'>field description metadata</a> and a <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/Likely_Public_Ownership/LikelyPublicOwnership_Documentation_11252014_Final.pdf' target='_blank'>narrative summary</a> detailing the creation of the dataset.</div><div><br /></div><div>For more information on the Motor City Mapping project, please visit www.motorcitymapping.org.</div>
