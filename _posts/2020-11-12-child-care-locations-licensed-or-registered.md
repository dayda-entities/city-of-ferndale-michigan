Locations of all Licensed and / or Registered childcare providers in Southeast Michigan from June 2014. Provided by the United Way of Southeast Michigan's Regional Resource Center, a partner of the Early Childhood Investment Corporation. Contains information on whether a provider is a Head Start or Great Start Readiness provider, as well as the quality rating from Great Start to Quality if a provider participates. This data was exported to Data Driven Detroit by the United Way for SE Michigan. Data Driven Detroit added fields indicating whether a location was physically in Detroit, and also a single field indicating whether a provider paricipated in either Head Start, Great Start or Early Head Start.
