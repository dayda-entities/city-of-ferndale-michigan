<p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>The Detroit Future City Strategic Framework is a 
land use planning document that was released in 2012. It outlines 
recommendations for transforming Detroit's land use policies and codes over the 
next fifty years, and covers a broad range of issues from economic and workforce 
development to transportation and green infrastructure. The shapes in this file 
represent the long-term planning framework zones identified in the plan. These 
zones have been identified based on vacancy and market characteristics, and are 
intended to shape and guide policy over the next fifty years. The geographies 
are based off of dissolved parcels from the City of Detroit Planning and 
Development Department.</p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'><br /></p>
