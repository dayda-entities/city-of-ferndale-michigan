All the Zip Codes that are at least partly within Detroit. These are the Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) as created by the US Census (TIGER), from 2012. ZCTA are close approximations of actual postal zip code boundaries, but align to census blocks. Actual Zip codes can cut through the middle of a block.Â
