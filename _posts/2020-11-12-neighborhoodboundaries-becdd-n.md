Neighborhood zones were created by Building the Engine of Community Development in Detroit in 2018. Zones were created first by associating each Detroit Neighborhood (defined by the City of Detroit's Department of Neighborhoods and the Detroit Land Bank Authority) with a Census Tract, then Census Tracts were assigned a Detroit City Council District. Finally the boundaries of the Council Districts were used to establish the zone boundaries.
