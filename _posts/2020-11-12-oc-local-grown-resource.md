This point feature class was created in November, 2013, by geocoding the address, as provided by various sources, to Oakland County's Road Centerline feature class. The resulting points were then georeferenced to the facility structure using Oakland County's 2012 orthoimagery at a reference scale of 1:1200. This dataset is not recreated each year. Instead it is verified and updated as necessary. In June, 2017, the existing feature class was compared to outside sources to verify if any updates or edits were necessary. The key attributes include the Name, Address, and Type (Farmer's Market, Honey, Retail, U-Pick, etc.).
