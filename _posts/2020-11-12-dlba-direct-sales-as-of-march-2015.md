<p>This dataset contains the locations of all properties that have been 
sold by the Detroit Land Bank Authority through a direct sale to a purchaser 
(rather than through their side lot or home auction programs). While most 
housing transactions fall into one of those two categories, a small number have 
been sold through other programs and means. Information contained in this dataset includes name of purchaser, 
date of transaction, and the cost the purchaser paid for the property. <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/DLBA_ProgramSales/Metadata_DLBADirectSales.xls' target='_blank'>Field description metadata are available for download</a> to provide more detail on the 
specific contents of the dataset.</p>
<p>The analyst downloaded these data in their raw format from the City of 
Detroit's Open Data Portal on March 31, 2015. The analyst then geocoded the data 
to spatialize the properties and assign a parcel ID to each record.</p>
