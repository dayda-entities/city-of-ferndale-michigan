<span style='color: rgb(95, 95, 95); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;'>The Medically Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA/P) show designated MUA/Ps as well as MUA/Ps as they relate to HRSA Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) designated rural health areas. MUA/P designations are based on the Index of Medical Underservice (IMU). IMU is calculated based on four criteria: population to provider ratio; percent of the population below the federal poverty level; percent of the population over age 65; and infant mortality rate.</span>
