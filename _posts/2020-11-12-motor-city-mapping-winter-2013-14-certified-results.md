The goal of the survey was to collect data on property condition and vacancy.  The effort, called Motor City Mapping, leveraged relationships with the Rock Ventures family of companies and the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation to assemble a dedicated team of over 200 resident surveyors, drivers, and quality control associates.  Data collection occurred from December 4, 2013 until February 16, 2014, and the initiative resulted in survey information for over 370,000 parcels of land in the city of Detroit, identifying condition, occupancy, and use. The data were then extensively reviewed by the Motor City Mapping quality control team, a process that concluded on September 30, 2014.  </span><br /></div><div><span style='line-height: 1.38461538461538;'><br /></span></div><div>The file contains the official certified results from the Winter 2013/2014 survey, including data on illegal dumping, fire damage, condition of a structure (from good to suggest demolition), existence of a structure or accessory structure, and whether there are improvements to lots with no structures.  The data collected by the survey formed the centerpiece of the Blight Removal Task Force’s report, “Every Neighborhood has a Future…and It Doesn’t Include Blight.” We look forward to seeing how this data can lead to a deeper understanding of our great city.
