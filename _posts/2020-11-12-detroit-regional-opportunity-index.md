The Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University developed the Detroit Regional Opportunity Index to compare levels of opportunity for people growing up in different parts of a region.  The Index was developed by combining many different data indicators for opportunity into a single score. More information on the Detroit methodology and composite data can be found here: http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20131211neighborhood.pdf
