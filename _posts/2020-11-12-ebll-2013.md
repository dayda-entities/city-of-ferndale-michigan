Blood lead levels from Samples taken by the Michigan Department of Community Health. The MDCH does both intervenous and capillary blood lead level testing on children under 6 and produces reports by Zip Code and community. The older standard considered 10 microGrams per deciLiter the elevated level threshold. The current standard considers 5 uG/dL and higher to be elevated.
