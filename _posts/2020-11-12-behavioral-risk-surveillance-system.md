The Detroit specific BRFSS data is drawn from the Michigan Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (MiBRFS), an annual, statewide telephone survey of Michigan adults aged 18 years and older that is conducted through a collaborative effort among the Population Health Surveillance Branch (PHSB) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Michigan State University Institute for Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR), and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Michigan BRFS data contribute to the national Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System that is managed by the PHSB at the CDC.
