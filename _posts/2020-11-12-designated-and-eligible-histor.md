<p>In the winter of 2013, the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force
commissioned Data Driven Detroit (D3) to serve as the data management partner
on Motor City Mapping, a comprehensive, city-wide data collection effort. As a
part of this project, D3 was tasked with compiling existing information on
historic districts in the City of Detroit, so that the city would be able to
identify all areas and structures of historic significance. </p><p>D3 compiled this
dataset from a number of different sources, which ranged from existing
shapefiles on the City of Detroit's website to drawing polygons manually based
on descriptions from the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). D3
analysts then subjected the data to an extensive manual cleaning process,
removing duplicates and reconciling conflicting boundaries. The resulting
dataset contains boundaries for 656 features, including national, state, and
locally-listed historic districts, as well as proposed/potential and eligible
historic districts. </p><p>This file is projected in

this dataset. </p><p><span style='line-height: 1.38461538461538;'>We look forward to seeing how this data
can be used to inform decisions and conversations around historic preservation
and historic buildings! If you would like to receive a more detailed process document
