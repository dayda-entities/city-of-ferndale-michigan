The list of schools in Detroit was obtained from the Michigan Educational Entity Master, Sept 3, 2014. All schools within the Wayne RESA area were downloaded and geocoded. Data Driven Detroit then geographically selected the schools that are in Detroit and excluded the closed and pending schools. Data Driven Detroit, with help from Excellent Schools Detroit then added fields to classify each school as a k8, k12, or HS. Some special education schools may not be included.
