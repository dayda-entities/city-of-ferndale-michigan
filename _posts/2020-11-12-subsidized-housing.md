This database includes the quantity of units available for individual programs and whether they are designated for seniors or families. Construction dates are also included where available. Twenty records are not geocoded because their addresses are not valid or they do not have specific addresses. In addition, records with multiple, unlisted locations were not geocoded. For individual programs, unit quantities are not mutually exclusive. According to Paul Bursley at MSHDA, in 2011, the database was last updated in 2009.<div><br /></div><div><div>Metadata are availableÂ <a href='http://www.datadrivendetroit.org/metadata/Subsidized_housing_metadata.xlsx' target='_blank'>here</a>.</div></div>
