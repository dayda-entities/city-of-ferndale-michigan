This dataset contains birth information, by county, for the state of Michigan in 2014. Included are births by ethnicity, number of births with inadequate prenatal care, number of low weight births, and births to teen mothers. Inadequate prenatal care was defined as births rated &quot;Intermediate&quot; or &quot;Inadequate&quot; on the Kessner Scale. Infants weighing under 2,500 grams were considered a low weight birth. Teen mothers were defined as mothers under the age of 20. Michigan Office of Vital Statistics provided individual birth data which was then suppressed by Data Driven Detroit.
