High School graduation rates for the 2016-2017 school year by census tract for the state of Michigan. Data Driven Detroit obtained these datasets from MI School Data, for the State of the Detroit Child tool in October 2018. Graduation rates were originally obtained on a school level and aggregated to tract by Data Driven Detroit. The graduation rates were calculated by Data Driven Detroit, using the count of students per cohort per school divided by the count of students who graduated.<div><br /></div><div>Click <a href='http://www.datadrivendetroit.org/metadata/GraduationRate_byTract_2016_2017_Metadata__20181022.xlsx' target='_blank'>here </a>for metadata (descriptions of the fields).<br /></div>
