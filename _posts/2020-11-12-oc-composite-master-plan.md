plans. These polygons were digitized from each of Oakland's 62 
community's future land use map in their master plan. The data was 
completed in March of 2006 and will be updated as each community amends 
their plan. The key attribute is Composite Plan representing 
generalized, countywide future land uses.<br /><br />This data depicts a 
future land use based on each community's master plan as currently 
adopted. The data will be updated each time a community amends their 
master plan. Below is a list recording the master plan and date of 
adoption that was used to digitize each community. <br /><ul><li>Township of Addison Addison Township Land Use Master Plan - 7/9/2002 </li><li>City

 category identified on the future land use map within each master plan 
was translated into a composite value. For example, one community may 
have two commercial districts- Local Commerical and General Commercial. 
Another community may have three commercial districts- Neighborhood 
Commercial, Hi-Tech Office, and Retail Commercial. A wide range of uses 
could be included in these categories, but for the purpose of this 
feature class, they are all translated into &quot;Commercial/Office.&quot; In some
 cases a category on community's future land use map could not be 
translated into a single composite category. When this occurred, areas 
were manually translated into the appropriate generalized category. For 
example, a Public Lands class on a community's map would be manually 
translated into the Public/Institutional and Recreation/Conservation composite categories.</div>
