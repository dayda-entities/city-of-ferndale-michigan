<p>In January, 2014, Data Driven Detroit (D3) purchased a license of the 
Valassis Corporation's VNEF Plus database to receive quarterly updates of 
address-level vacancy data. Though the address-level data are restricted by 
confidentiality clauses, D3 processed and aggregated this database to the Census 
block-level to provide high-resolution tracking of structure vacancy in Detroit 
across time. The dataset contains data on the number and percent of vacant 
structures (with whether a parcel contains a structure identified by Motor City 
Mapping survey data) in each of the nearly 16,000 Census blocks in Detroit. The 
data span the timeframe from Q4 2013 through Q4 2014.</p>
