2013 Medicaid figures for southeast Michigan counties of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb at the ZCTA level. This data represent number of visits, they are not counts of different individuals, only of visits. One person could have had multiple visits and each visit would be counted. Blank cells indicate no visits. Whether a visit is coded as a hospital or ER visit depends on the DRG, Diagnosis-Related Group; that is, the diagnosis.
