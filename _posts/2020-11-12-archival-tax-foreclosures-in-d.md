<p>Wayne County follows a relatively fixed process for initiating tax 
foreclosures. The county serves notice to any parcel that is more than three 
years delinquent on property tax payments, and these properties are then sold to 
the highest bidder in two auctions - one in early September, and one in October. 
While there have been some exceptions to this schedule (a June 2012 auction of 
unsold foremost among them), properties listed in the September tax auction 
represent a strong proxy for identifying the universe of tax-foreclosed 
properties.</p>
<p>This file identifies parcels within the City of Detroit that were 
listed in the September Wayne County tax foreclosure auction in any year from 
2002 through 2013. It contains information on year of foreclosure, as well as 
the total number of times that a property has been subject to tax foreclosure. 
The work to produce this dataset was conducted in September 2013, and the data 
were subsequently integrated into the Motor City Mapping project.</p>
<p>The purpose of this file is to help provide information on how 
Detroit's tax foreclosure crisis has developed over time, enabling community 
members and decision-makers to make more informed decisions when developing 
strategies to combat this growing problem.</p>
