Michigan open public and private school locations, downloaded from the Michigan Edcuational Entity Master (EEM) in January 2015. A small number of schools did not geocode (&lt;.1%). D3 staff only selected schools that were labeled as open and then geocoded them. Individual verification of matches was not undertaken. &quot;Matchingaddress&quot; is the address from the reference locator where the program automatically matched the actual address. Data Driven Detroit added the field &quot;Municipality_D3&quot; to indicate which schools were physically in the City. Occasionally, we found that the self identified field &quot;EntityPhysicalCity&quot; was inaccurate for schools near the border of Detroit. The data can be downloaded from the MISchoolData.org website, along with more information:Â  <a href='https://www.mischooldata.org/DistrictSchoolProfiles/EntitySummary/SchoolDataFile.aspx' target='_blank'>https://www.mischooldata.org/DistrictSchoolProfiles/EntitySummary/SchoolDataFile.aspx</a>
