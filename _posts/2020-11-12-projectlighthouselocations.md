The Detroit Police Department and more than 30 businesses in the Central Business District have partnered together to launch this program to provide shelter, aid, safety, information and potential lodging for those in temporary need of assistance. Each participating business, known as a Lighthouse, has security personnel available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to assist those in need. With a simple phone call to 313-471-6490, help will be provided to anyone who is lost, separated from friends, having vehicle trouble or has other safety concerns. In addition, any business displaying a Project Lighthouse banner is considered a safe haven.
