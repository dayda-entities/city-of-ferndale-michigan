<div>1) The incident numbers have been anonymized, and do not correlate with the CLEMIS (internal police data) number. Note that there are sometimes multiple rows for the same incident. </div><div> </div><div>2) The data set includes the number of Narcan Kits used by police in each incident.</div><div> </div><div>3) Because there can be multiple rows for the same incident, the Narcan use and kits can also be duplicated. There are 31 current uses of Narcan by the Police, but 37 rows are flagged as having used Narcan because of multiple codes on the same incident. This is important to note so users of the data set doesn't double count the number of incidents, or artificially inflate the number of kits used by counting them multiple times for the same incident.</div><div> </div><div>4) The addresses have been anonymized to the block level.</div><div> </div><div>5) All drug-related incidents since 2007 have been pulled (codes 35XX), but several instances of Narcan use were in other categories. Therefore the data set also includes all C3225 incidents (drug overdose), as well as 3 other codes (C3217, C3208, C3332) because they had Narcan uses. However, these 3 were only for the incidents that involved Narcan (so all other incidents of C3217, C3208, and C3332 codes were not pulled).</div><div> </div><div>6) Sometimes a block number is given, sometimes two cross streets, and sometimes only a general street for location data. This is just a limitation of what was entered into CLEMIS at the time. The addresses were geocoded in a batch process.</div>
