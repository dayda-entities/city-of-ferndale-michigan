<p>This dataset contains information on the ratio of family income to the 
federal poverty level at the zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) level. Each column 
beginning with a &quot;T_&quot; lists the total number of families that fall into each 
income category. In addition, the dataset contains information on margins of 
error and the reliability of each estimate, to help guide decisionmakers in more 
effectively using the data contained in this file. There are approximately 1,000 
records in this dataset. ZCTA boundaries are designed to approximate actual zip 
code boundaries, but are fixed to allow for consistent data analysis (whereas 
regular zip code boundaries change frequently).</p>
