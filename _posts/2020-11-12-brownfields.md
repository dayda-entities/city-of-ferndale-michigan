<p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>The analyst downloaded the raw data used to develop 
this dataset from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). 
Pursuant to statutory guidelines under the Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection Act (NREPA), the DEQ is required to 
“post on its website an inventory 
of residential closures and a separate inventory of other known 
facilities.” For the 
purposes of this dataset, 
“residential 
closures”have not been 
included; these were submitted to the DEQ in a No Further Action Report and 
satisfy remediation standards for Residential Facilities. 
All“other known facilities” 
available are included in the Inventory of Facilities 
dataset that serves as the foundation for this layer.</p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'><br /></p>
<p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'></p>
<p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>The Inventory of Facilities includes all locations 
where there have been a release of hazardous substances as defined under 
multiple subsets of NREPA. Although this list is commonly referred to as 
Brownfields, it can contain other types of designations including but not 
limited to: Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUST), Baseline Environmental 
Site Assessments (BEAs) and Environmental Site Assessments. Each of these 
designations requires further action, and the sites are pursuing cleanup in 
conjunction with the DEQ. </p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'><br /></p>
<p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'></p>
<p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>It is also important to mention that this inventory 
does not necessarily include every facility that is subject to 
NREPA’s guidelines, since owners 
are not required to inform the DEQ about the facilities and can pursue cleanup 
independently. Facilities that are not known to the DEQ are not on the 
inventory, nor are locations with releases that resulted in little or no 
environmental impact.</p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'><br /></p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>Metadata associated with this file includes <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/Brownfields/Metadata_Brownfields_1113.xls' target='_blank'>field description metadata</a> and a <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/Brownfields/Narrative_Brownfields1113_11262014.pdf' target='_blank'>narrative summary</a> detailing the creation of this dataset.</p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'><br /></p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;'>For more information about the Motor City Mapping project, please visit www.motorcitymapping.org.</p>
