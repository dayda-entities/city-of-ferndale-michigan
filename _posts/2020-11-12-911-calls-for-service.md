This table shows all 911 police emergency response and officer-initiated
 calls for service in the City of Detroit since September 20, 2016. 
Emergency response calls are the result of people calling 911 to request
 police services. Officer-initiated calls include traffic stops, street 
investigations and other policing activities (such as observing crimes 
in progress) where police officers initiate the response. The table 
includes all calls taken, dispatch, travel, and total response times for
 those calls serviced by a police agency. The data also include the 
responding agency, unit, call type and category of each call. Should you
 have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Commanding
