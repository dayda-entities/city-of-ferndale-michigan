This dataset contains college readiness information, by Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), for the state of Michigan. This dataset is reporting score information from the 2017-2018 school year. Students were considered ready for college if they scored at or above the benchmark scores. The SAT Benchmarks represent the likelihood of success in entry-level college courses.  The benchmark for Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) is 480 and 530 for Math.  The SAT total score reported for Michigan is the combined Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing, and Math Student Score. The Total Score range is 400 – 1600.  Data Driven Detroit obtained this data from MiSchoolData.org in October 2018 at a building level and aggregated the data to a MSA level. <div><br /></div><div>Click <a href='http://www.datadrivendetroit.org/metadata/CollegeReadiness_20172018_byMSA_Metadata_20181108.xlsx' target='_blank'>here</a> for metadata (descriptions of the fields).<br /></div>
