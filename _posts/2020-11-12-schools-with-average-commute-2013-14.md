The Michigan Center for Educational Performance and Information (CEPI), working with the Michigan Center for Shared Solutions (CSS) provided Data Driven Detroit (D3) with census block codes approximating student residence locations from the October 2013 student count for all students attending a public school in Detroit (DPS, Charter, EAA). With this data, D3 calculated the street-grid distance traveled from home (approximate location) to school for each student that attended a school in Detroit. We then calculated an average distance traveled by students of each school. Ann Arbor Magnet school (and possibly others) is not included in these data due to omission from the original data submission to D3. Average distances were calculated after first removing outlier student locations in counties outside of Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and Washtenaw. Distances were calculated using shortest distance routes from schools to the center of the Census Tract of residence.
