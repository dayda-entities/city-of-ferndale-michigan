The survey contains data on 17,500 properties in eligible historic districts across the six Hardest-Hit Fund districts. Volunteer surveyors answered three main questions about each property: its architectural integrity (&quot;Architectu&quot;), how in-keeping it was with neighborhood character (&quot;Building_w&quot;), and how intact its block was (&quot;Block_Inta&quot;). These three questions were aggregated into a Historic Preservation Score (HP_SCORE) aimed to help distill the survey data for decision-makers.
