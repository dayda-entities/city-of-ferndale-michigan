<p>The D3 vacancy index was designed to provide a more nuanced assessment 
of structural vacancy than the &quot;occupied/unoccupied/maybe&quot; categories used in 
the Motor City Mapping windshield survey. The dataset includes several sources, 
including Motor City Mapping, utility data, and other resources to create a 
score evaluating the occupancy status of a parcel. These values are then coded 
as &quot;Likely Occupied&quot;, &quot;Potentially Vacant&quot;, &quot;Likely Vacant&quot;, and &quot;Very Likely 
Vacant&quot;, helping to show a spectrum of vacancy across Detroit.</p>
<p>Because the vacancy index incorporates proprietary data sources, D3 is 
unable to release the raw values of the index to the public at the address 
level. To allow the public to obtain some of the benefit from this 
highly-effective tool, however, D3 aggregated this data to the Census Tract 
level. This file allows Detroit's policymakers and community members to track 
vacancy across the city using data that is as up-to-date as 
possible.</p><p>Metadata associated with this file includes <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/Vacancy_Index_Aggregation/Metadata_VacancyIndexAggregation.xls' target='_blank'>field description metadata</a> and a <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/Vacancy_Index_Aggregation/VacancyCount_Aggregated_Documentation_Final_12302014.pdf' target='_blank'>narrative summary</a> documenting the creation of the dataset.</p></div>
