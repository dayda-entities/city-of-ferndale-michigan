<p>This dataset contains the locations of all properties that have been 
sold by the Detroit Land Bank Authority under their side lot program. This 
program sells vacant lots to adjacent homeowners for a small fee in exchange for 
the homeowner agreeing to maintain the empty parcel. More information on the 
side lot program can be found here: <a href='http://www.buildingdetroit.org/our-programs/side-lot-sales/' target='_blank'>http://www.buildingdetroit.org/our-programs/side-lot-sales/</a>. This dataset 
includes information on purchasers, as well as the costs and dates for each 
transaction. <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/DLBA_ProgramSales/Metadata_DLBASideLotSales.xls' target='_blank'>Field description metadata are available for download</a> to provide more detail on the specific contents of the dataset.</p>
<p>The analyst downloaded these data in their raw format from the City of 
Detroit's Open Data Portal on March 31, 2015. The anaylst then geocoded the data 
to spatialize the properties and assign parcel IDs to the records. Finally, the 
analyst removed duplicate records from the database.</p>
