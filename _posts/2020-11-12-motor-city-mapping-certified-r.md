<p>In the fall of 2013, the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force commissioned 
Data Driven Detroit, the Michigan Nonprofit Association, and LOVELAND 
Technologies to conduct a survey of every parcel in the City of Detroit. The 
goal of the survey was to collect data on property condition and vacancy. The 
effort, called Motor City Mapping, leveraged relationships with the Rock 
Ventures family of companies and the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation to 
assemble a dedicated team of over 200 resident surveyors, drivers, and quality 
control associates. Data collection occurred from December 4, 2013 until 
February 16, 2014, and the initiative resulted in survey information for over 
370,000 parcels of land in the city of Detroit, identifying condition, 
occupancy, and use. The data were then extensively reviewed by the Motor City 
Mapping quality control team, a process that concluded on September 30, 2014.

<p>This file contains the official certified results from the Winter 
2013/2014 survey, aggregated to 2010 Census Tracts for easy mapping and 
analysis. The topics covered in the dataset include totals and calculated 
percentages for parcels in the categories of illegal dumping, fire damage, 
structural condition, existence of a structure or accessory structure, and 
improvements on lots without structures.</p><p>Metadata associated with this file includes <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/MCM_CertifiedResults_TractAgg/Metadata_MCM_CertifiedResults_12302014.xls' target='_blank'>field description metadata</a> and a <a href='http://datadrivendetroit.org/web_ftp/motorcitymapping/Metadata/MCM_CertifiedResults_TractAgg/MCM_CertifiedResults_Documentation_Final_12302014.pdf' target='_blank'>narrative summary</a> documenting the process of creating the dataset.</p>
