Data Driven Detroit calculated the predominant race (if any) for census tracts in the Detroit, Tri-County region. The data come from the 2010 Census PL file. The census table splits out races by hispanic and non-hispanic ethnicity. For the purposes of this feature, White, Black, Hispanic or no predominant race were used as the possible categories. If there was no race or ethnicnicity over 50% of the population, then there is no predominant race.
