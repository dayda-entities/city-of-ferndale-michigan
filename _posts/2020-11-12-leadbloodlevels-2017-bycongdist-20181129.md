This dataset contains lead blood levels, by Congressional District, for the state of Michigan in 2017. An elevated blood lead level (EBLL) was defined by blood lead levels above 4.5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). Data Driven Detroit received lead blood level test results for individuals in the state from Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and then aggregated the data to anonymize results. <span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>Areas with n</span><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;'>ull values represent no blood lead level testing or numbers that have been suppressed (less than 6) to protect the tested individuals. </span><div><br /></div><div>Click <a href='http://www.datadrivendetroit.org/metadata/LeadBloodLevels_2017_byCongressionalDistricts_Metadata_20181129.xlsx' target='_blank'>here</a> for metadata (descriptions of the fields).</div>
