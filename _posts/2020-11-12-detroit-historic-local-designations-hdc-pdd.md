Locally designated historic places maintained by The Detroit Historic District Commission which is a city agency that was formed by Detroit Ordinance 161-H in 1976. Its purpose is to ensure the preservation of historically and culturally significant areas of the City which are designated by the City Council as Historic Districts. The Commission is made up of seven Detroit residents who are appointed by Mayor. These dedicated volunteers are generally residents of historic districts and represent such professions as architects and realtors. The Commission staff is located within the City of Detroit's Planning & Development Department.
