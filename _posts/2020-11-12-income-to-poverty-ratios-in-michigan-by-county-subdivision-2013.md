<p>This dataset contains information on the ratio of family income to the 
federal poverty level at the county subdivision level. Each column beginning 
with a &quot;T_&quot; lists the total number of families that fall into each income 
category. In addition, the dataset contains information on margins of error and 
the reliability of each estimate, to help guide decisionmakers in more 
effectively using the data contained in this file. There are approximately 1,600 
records in this dataset. County subdivisions consist of incorporated cities and 
townships, and do not cross county borders.</p>
