The linear natural waterway features were stereo compiled at a scale of 1:1200 using Oakland County's 2000 orthophotography as a reference. Drain feature locations were derived from conversion efforts from paper and digital construction plans.Key attributes include the Asset Maintainer, ReachCode and the GNISID as defined in the the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Note: NextDownID fields that equal -1 means there is no feature downstream.
