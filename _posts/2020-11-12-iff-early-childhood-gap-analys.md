IFF analysis on early childhood educational settings and availabilty, paid for by the Kellogg Foundation, 2017. Report: http://kresge.org/sites/default/files/library/iff-detroit-report-final.pdf . IFF studied the supply of childcare, including Great Start, Head Start, and Early Head Start program funding and availability (slots). They compared supply to demand by estimating the number of 0-5 year olds and those who would qualify for those programs. They used Detroit master planning areas as their unit of analysis and ranked each area in terms of need.
