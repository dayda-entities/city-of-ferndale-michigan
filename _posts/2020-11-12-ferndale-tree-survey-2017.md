Management of city-owned trees is an important part of any city maintenance program. This tree survey data was exported from Davey TreeKeeper 7, a service contracted by the city to survey the health and location of city-owned trees within the city of Ferndale, MI. The Survey is being conducted in 4 phases, with two areas now surveyed and two more to be completed in the future.
