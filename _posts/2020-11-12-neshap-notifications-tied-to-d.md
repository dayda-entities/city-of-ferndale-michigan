<p>NESHAP is a program of the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency that regulates hazardous air pollutants and ensures that construction and 
demolition activities are in compliance with federal regulations. As a part of 
this program, the State of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) 
requires notification from all contractors conducting alterations (either 
rehabilitation or demolition) on structures that have the potential to contain a 
hazardous substance such as lead or asbestos, regardless of whether the 
structure is actually found to contain the hazardous material. Because of this 
requirement, NESHAP notifications are an excellent proxy for identifying 
structures that have been demolished.</p>
<p>This dataset contains information on NESHAP notifications that have 
been identified as tied to demolition activity. The notifications date from 2009 
through April, 2015, and have been sourced from the MDEQ's website as well as 
several tables obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. The data 
contain information on the contractors for each demolition, the start and end 
date for the notification, and whether the property was surveyed as a 
residential structure in the 2009 Detroit Residential Parcel Survey.</p>
