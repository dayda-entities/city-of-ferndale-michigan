This data used to create this line feature class was collected between 3/29/17 and 5/3/17. The 1-foot elevation contours were created on 12/13/18 by Axis Geospatial, and the County then created 10' contours from these. The  1' contours were derived from Bare-Earth (DEMs) created from QL2 LiDAR data that was collected as part of the State of Michigan's 2016 LiDAR project. The key attribute is Contour.</div>
