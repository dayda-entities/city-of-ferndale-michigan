This depicts the approximate route of the M1 Rail / QLine from Woodward near Congress on the south end to North of Grand Blvd.  This layer was drawn by DDP staff from maps to run along Woodward avenue.  It was not digitized from photos. In addition, this depiction shows the route running straight through Campus Martius Park, as opposed to the true route, whic h runs along Woodward around the Park.
